Overview
--------

Learn how to observe the behavior of your MongoDB source or sink
connector through **monitoring** and **logging**.
Monitoring is the process of getting information about the
activities a running program performs for use in an application
or an application performance management library.
Logging is the process of a programming writing output to log
files.

The {+mkc+} uses {+jmx-long+} to enable monitoring, and
{+l4j+} to enable logging.


Monitoring
----------

The {+mkc+} uses {+kafka-connect+}'s metrics infrastructure to
serve metrics. To read the metrics produced by your connector,
enable JMX and launch your {+kafka-connect+} deployment.

To learn how to enable JMX for a {+kafka-connect+} instance
running on your host machine, see the
`Official Kafka Documentation <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#monitoring>`__.

To learn how to enable JMX for a containerized {+kafka-connect+}
deployment, see
`Kafka Monitoring and Metrics Using JMX with Docker <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/docker/operations/monitoring.html>`__.

Example - Monitor the Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sample environment provided in the Quick Start exposes metrics
on your host machine at the URI ``localhost:35000``.

To view these metrics with ``jconsole``, perform the following actions:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Start The Quick Start Pipeline and Add Connectors

      Follow the Quick Start until the :ref:`<kafka-quick-start-send-a-document>`
      step.

   .. step:: Start jconsole

      Run the following command to start ``jconsole``:

      .. code-block:: shell

         jconsole

   .. step:: Connect to {+kafka-connect+} JMX Server

      Enter the URI ``localhost:35000`` into the Remote Process
      text input box in the JConsole interface.

      Press the Connect button.

      Press the Insecure Connection in the dialog box.

   .. step:: Explore Metrics

      Navigate to the MBeans tab.

      Inspect connector metrics in the ``{+metrics-path+}`` path.
