Available Metrics
-----------------

Use the attributes in the tables in this section to monitor the behavior of your source and
sink connectors through {+jmx-long+} (JMX).

.. tip:: JMX Attributes

   {+jmx-hover+} represents an individual metric as an attribute of an ``MBean``.
   To learn more about attributes and ``MBeans``, see the
   `Standard MBeans Tutorial <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html>`__
