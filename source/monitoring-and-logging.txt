Sink Connector JMX Metrics
--------------------------

Use the attributes in the following table to monitor the behavior of your sink
connector through {+jmx-long+} (JMX):

.. tip:: JMX Attributes

   {+jmx-hover+} represents an individual metric as an attribute of an ``MBean``.
   To learn more about attributes and ``MBeans``, see the
   `Standard MBeans Tutorial <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html>`__
   from Oracle.

   * - Attribute Name
     - Description

   * - **records**
     - The total number of Kafka records a MongoDB sink task received.

   * - **records-successful**
     - The total number of Kafka records a MongoDB sink task successfully
       wrote to MongoDB.

   * - **records-failed**
     - The total number of Kafka records a MongoDB sink task failed to write
       to MongoDB.

   * - **latest-kafka-time-difference-ms**
     - The number of milliseconds of the most recent time difference recorded
       between a MongoDB sink task and Kafka. This value is calculated by
       subtracting the current time of the connector's clock and the timestamp
       of the last record the task received.

   * - **in-task-put**
     - The total number of times the Kafka Connect framework executed the
       ``put()`` method of the MongoDB sink task.

   * - **in-task-put-duration**
     - The total number of milliseconds the Kafka Connect framework spent
       executing the ``put()`` method of a MongoDB sink task.

   * - **in-task-put-duration-over-1-ms**
     - The total number of MongoDB sink task ``put()`` method executions
       with a duration that exceeded 1 millisecond.

   * - **in-task-put-duration-over-10-ms**
     - The total number of MongoDB sink task ``put()`` method executions
       with a duration that exceeded 10 milliseconds.

   * - **in-task-put-duration-over-100-ms**
     - The total number of MongoDB sink task ``put()`` method executions
       with a duration that exceeded 100 milliseconds.

   * - **in-task-put-duration-over-1000-ms**
     - The total number of MongoDB sink task ``put()`` method executions
       with a duration that exceeded 1000 milliseconds.

   * - **in-task-put-duration-over-10000-ms**
     - The total number of MongoDB sink task ``put()`` method executions
       with a duration that exceeded 10000 milliseconds.

   * - **in-connect-framework**
     - The total number of times code in the Kafka Connect framework
       executed after the first invocation of the ``put()`` method of the
       MongoDB sink task.

   * - **in-connect-framework-duration**
     - The total number of milliseconds spent executing code in the Kafka
       Connect framework since the framework first invoked the ``put()``
       method of the MongoDB sink task. This metric does not count time
       executing code in the MongoDB sink task towards the total.

   * - **in-connect-framework-duration-over-1-ms**
     - The total number of times code in the Kafka Connect framework
       executed for a duration that exceeded 1 millisecond.

   * - **in-connect-framework-duration-over-10-ms**
     - The total number of times code in the Kafka Connect framework
       executed for a duration that exceeded 10 milliseconds.

   * - **in-connect-framework-duration-over-100-ms**
     - The total number of times code in the Kafka Connect framework
       executed for a duration that exceeded 100 milliseconds.

   * - **in-connect-framework-duration-over-1000-ms**
     - The total number of times code in the Kafka Connect framework executed
       for a duration that exceeded 1000 milliseconds.

   * - **in-connect-framework-duration-over-10000-ms**
     - The total number of times code in the Kafka Connect framework executed
       for a duration that exceeded 10000 milliseconds.

   * - **processing-phases**
     - The total number of times a MongoDB sink task executed the processing
       phase on a batch of records from Kafka. The processing phase of a
       MongoDB sink task is the set of actions that starts after records are
       obtained from Kafka and ends before records are written to MongoDB.

   * - **processing-phases-duration**
     - The total number of milliseconds a MongoDB sink task spent processing
       records before writing them to MongoDB.

     - The total number of MongoDB sink task processing phase executions with
       a duration that exceeded 1 millisecond.

   * - **processing-phases-duration-over-10-ms**
     - The total number of MongoDB sink task processing phase executions with
       a duration that exceeded 10 milliseconds.

       writing to the MongoDB server.

     - The total number of successful batch writes performed by the MongoDB
       sink task with a duration that exceeded 1 millisecond.

   * - **batch-writes-successful-duration-over-10-ms**
