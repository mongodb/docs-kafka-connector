Overview
--------

Learn how to observe the behavior of your MongoDB source or sink
connector through **monitoring**.
Monitoring is the process of getting information about the
activities a running program performs for use in an application
or an application performance management library.

To learn how monitoring works in the connector and how to use
it, see the :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-information>` section.

To view an example that shows how to monitor a running connector,
see the :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-example>` section. 

To view a list of all metrics produced by MongoDB source and sink
connectors, see the :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-all-attributes>` section.

To learn more about logging in the connector, see the
:ref:`<kafka-logging>` guide.

.. _kafka-monitoring-information:

Monitor the Connector
---------------------

The {+mkc+} uses **{+jmx-long+} (JMX)** to enable monitoring.
JMX is a technology included in the {+java-se+} that provides
tools to monitor applications and devices. You can view the
metrics produced by the connector with any JMX console, such
as ``jconsole``.

The {+mkc+} provides metrics for individual connector **tasks**.
Tasks are classes instantiated by a connector that copy data to and
from data stores and {+ak+}. A connector manages one or more tasks.

To learn more about JMX, see the following resources from Oracle:

- `Java Management Extensions Guide <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/jmx/introduction-jmx-technology.html>`__
- `Using JConsole <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/management/using-jconsole.html>`__

To learn more about tasks in {+kc+}, see the following resources:

- `Kafka Connect Concepts from Confluent <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/concepts.html#tasks>`__
- `{+kc+} API documentation for Task interface <https://kafka.apache.org/21/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/Task.html>`__

Enable Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+mkc+} uses {+kc+}'s metrics infrastructure to
serve metrics. To read the metrics produced by your connector,
enable JMX in your {+kc+} deployment.

To learn how to enable JMX for a {+kc+} instance
running on your host machine, see the
`Official Kafka Documentation <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#monitoring>`__.

To learn how to enable JMX for a containerized {+kc+}
deployment, see
`Kafka Monitoring and Metrics Using JMX with Docker <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/docker/operations/monitoring.html>`__.

.. _kafka-monitoring-example:

Example - Monitor the Quick Start
---------------------------------

The sample environment provided in the Quick Start exposes metrics
on your host machine at the URI ``localhost:35000``.

To view these metrics with ``jconsole``, perform the following actions:

.. tip:: Download jconsole

   ``jconsole`` is part of the {+java-se+}. To download ``jconsole``, download the
   `Java SE Development Kit <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/>`__
   from Oracle.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Start The Quick Start Pipeline and Add Connectors

      Follow the Quick Start until the :ref:`<kafka-quick-start-send-a-document>`
      step.

   .. step:: Start jconsole

      Run the following command from your command line to start ``jconsole``:

      .. code-block:: shell

         jconsole

   .. step:: Connect to {+kc+} JMX Server

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Enter Your JMX Server URI

            Enter the URI ``localhost:35000`` into the :guilabel:`Remote Process`
            text input box in the JConsole interface.

         .. step:: Press the :guilabel:`Connect` button.

         .. step:: Press the :guilabel:`Insecure Connection` button in the dialog box.

   .. step:: Explore Metrics

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`MBeans` tab in ``jconsole``.

         .. step:: Inspect connector metrics.

            Notice that the ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-0.records``
            attribute has a value of ``0``.

         .. step:: Continue the Quick Start

            Continue the Quick Start until, but not through, the
            :ref:`<kafka-quickstart-remove-the-sandbox>` step.

            After completeing the preceding sections of the Quick Start,
            the ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-0.records``
            attribute should now have a value of ``1``.            

.. _kafka-monitoring-all-attributes:

Available Metrics
-----------------

Use the attributes in the tables in this section to monitor the behavior of your source and
sink connectors through {+jmx-long+} (JMX).

.. tip:: JMX Attributes

   {+jmx-hover+} represents an individual metric as an attribute of an ``MBean``.
   To learn more about attributes and ``MBeans``, see the
   `Standard MBeans Tutorial <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html>`__
   from Oracle.

.. note:: Poll and Put Methods

   A MongoDB source connector task has a ``poll()`` method to retrieve
   documents from MongoDB and send them to {+ak+}. A MongoDB sink
   connector task has a ``put()`` method to retrieve documents from {+ak+}
   and send them to MongoDB.

   To learn more about ``poll()`` and ``put()`` methods, see the following
   resources:

   - `{+kc+} API documentation for SourceTask interface <https://kafka.apache.org/21/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/source/SourceTask.html>`__
   - `{+kc+} API documentation for SinkTask interface <https://kafka.apache.org/21/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/sink/SinkTask.html>`__

Source Connector JMX Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Source Connector Tasks and getMore

   Some metrics for source connector tasks distinguish between
   **initial commands** and ``getMore`` commands. An initial
   command is a ``find`` or ``aggregate`` command sent to a MongoDB
   instance that retrieves the first set of documents in a client-side
   MongoDB cursor. A ``getMore`` command is a MongoDB command that fetches
   a new set of documents to replace a set of documents populating a cursor.

   To learn more about ``getMore`` commands, see <TODO: link to getMore in server>.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Attribute Name
     - Description

   * - **records**
     - The total number of records a MongoDB source task passed to the
       {+kc+} framework.

   * - **records-filtered**
     - The number of records a MongoDB source task passed to the
       {+kc+} framework that were then filtered by the framework.
       A filtered record is not written to Kafka.

   * - **records-acknowledged**
     - The total number of records a MongoDB source task passed to the
       {+kc+} framework that were then successfully
       written to Kafka.

   * - **mongodb-bytes-read**
     - The total number of bytes a MongoDB source task read from the
       MongoDB server.

       .. tip:: Average Record size

          You can calculate the average size of the records your sink connector
          processed over a span of time by performing the following actions:

          #. Determine the change in the value of the ``mongodb-bytes-read``
             attribute for a span of time.
          #. Determine the change in the value of the ``records`` attribute
             for the same span of time you used for the preceding step.
          #. Divide the change in the value of the ``mongodb-bytes-read`` attribute
             by the change in the value of the ``records`` attribute.

   * - **latest-mongodb-time-difference-secs**
     - The number of seconds of the most recent time difference recorded between
       a MongoDB server and the post-batch resume token held by a MongoDB
       source task. This value is calculated by subtracting the timestamp

       the most recent successful MongoDB command executed by the task.
