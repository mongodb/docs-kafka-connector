============
Topic Naming
============

The example on this page shows how to configure your {+source-connector+}
to customize the name of the topic to which it publishes records.

By default, the MongoDB Kafka source connector publishes change event data
to a Kafka topic with the same name as the MongoDB **namespace** from which
the change events originated. A namespace is a string that's composed of the
database and collection name concatenated with a dot "." character.

Topic Prefix Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure your source connector to prepend a string to the
namespace of the change event data, and publish records to that Kafka
topic. This setting automatically concatenates your prefix with your
namespace with the "." character.

To specify the topic prefix, use the ``topic.prefix`` configuration
setting as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ini
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   topic.prefix=myPrefix
   database=test
   collection=data

Once set, your connector publishes any changes to the ``data`` collection
in the ``test`` database to the Kafka topic named ``myPrefix.test.data``.
