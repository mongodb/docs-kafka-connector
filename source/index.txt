Overview
--------

The `{+connector-long+} <https://www.mongodb.com/kafka-connector>`__ is
a Confluent-verified connector that persists data from {+kafka+} topics as a
data sink into MongoDB and publishes changes from MongoDB into Kafka
topics as a data source.

We recommend that you use one of the following MongoDB partner service 
offerings to host your {+kafka+} cluster and {+connector+}:

- `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/lp/confluent-cloud/>`__
- `Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) <https://aws.amazon.com/msk/>`__
- `Redpanda Cloud <https://redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud>`__
